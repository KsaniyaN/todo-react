# Working on task

First of all, the last time I worked with React was 3 years ago.\
So, I'm taking some time to refresh the basic concepts of this library.

Not so long ago I was building a similar ToDo list on Vue3. So, the task is familiar for me.

I'll divide it into a few steps\User stories\
(Each step includes adding styles & accessibility features where necessary)\

	+ read a list of tasks\

	+ create\add a todo item\

	+ mark task as completed without deleting it\

	+ delete todo item\

	+ edit todo item\	

	+ filter tasks: all tasks, active, completed\
    
    + remove extra comments, console logs

    ToDo:
	> tests (App.test.js)\
